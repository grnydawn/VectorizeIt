# VectorizeIt
Experiments on Vectorization Techniques

# Plan
- define goals of experiment
- put benchmarks in place
- setup testing for the benchmarks
- setup data collection for the benchmarks
- setup analysis for the benchmarks
- define goals of next experiment and return back to one of previous steps 

# Benchmarks
- Levine's vectorization benchmark

# Considerations for goal setup
- How effective are currently available vectorization tools?
- How to get ideas for improving vectorization?
- How to accumulate knowledge for vectorization techniques?
- How to objectively compare vectorization artifacts including speedup, effort, hw/sw impact, etc.?
- How to share vectorization outcomes easily?
- How to automate vectorization tasks?

# Workflow
- T.B.A
